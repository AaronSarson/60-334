# 60-334: PHP WEB APP

This web application was developed for the final project of 60-334: World Wide Development. The project required the
development of a web applicaiton that made use of basic web technologies such as HTML, PHP, CSS, AJAX, XSLT, and XML. There was also a requirement of storing user specific data in MySQL database tables.

The web application that we developed is a story book generator where users can enter a title for your story, as well as select from a prededefined list of characters, villains, and story templates. The web app then generates a story with corresponding images based on your selection.
